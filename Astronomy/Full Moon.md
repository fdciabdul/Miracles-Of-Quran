A full moon is a phase of the moon that occurs when the moon appears fully illuminated from the perspective of Earth. This happens when the moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the sun, with the Earth positioned directly between the sun and the moon.

During a full moon, the entire face of the moon that is visible from Earth is illuminated by the sun's light, creating a bright and distinct circular shape. The full moon is typically the brightest and most noticeable phase of the moon, and it can often be seen in the sky for several nights in a row.

The full moon is also an important cultural and religious symbol in many societies, and is associated with various traditions and beliefs. For example, in some cultures, the full moon is thought to have an influence on human behavior or the natural world, while in others it is associated with certain festivals or celebrations.

_________________________

The full moon is only visible from sunset to sunrise. Because Earth is spherical it is impossible for people in daytime to see the full moon; they have to wait for Earth to rotate such that they face the full moon (if Earth were flat everybody would have seen the full moon at the same time). This was only known recently, however this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years ago.



Quran 84:16-18



Here the full moon can only be seen from twilight then all night long; but not during the day. Today we know that this is correct because Earth is not flat but spherical. No mistakes in the Quran.
