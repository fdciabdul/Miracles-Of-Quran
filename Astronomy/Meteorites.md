# Meteorites

A meteorite is a solid piece of debris, usually from an asteroid or comet, that survives its journey through the Earth's atmosphere and lands on the Earth's surface. Meteorites are composed of various materials, including rock, metal, and stony-iron mixtures, and can range in size from tiny particles to large boulders.

When a meteoroid (a small rocky or metallic body moving through space) enters the Earth's atmosphere, it heats up and creates a bright streak of light in the sky called a meteor or shooting star. If the meteoroid is large enough, it can survive the intense heat and pressure of atmospheric entry and land on the Earth's surface as a meteorite.

Meteorites are valuable to scientists because they provide information about the origins and composition of the solar system, as well as the geology and history of the Earth itself. By studying meteorites, scientists can learn about the formation and evolution of planets, the chemical and physical conditions of the early solar system, and the effects of cosmic impacts on the Earth's surface and environment.

When those meteorites enter our atmosphere the heat generated on entry burns them into ashes. This was only known recently, however this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered.



Quran 52:44

Even if they were to see lumps of the sky falling down, they would say, "A mass of clouds."



٤٤ وَإِنْ يَرَوْا كِسْفًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ سَاقِطًا يَقُولُوا سَحَابٌ مَرْكُومٌ



They would think that they are clouds because their ash looks like clouds.
