> In astronomy, axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is the angle between an object's rotational axis and its orbital axis, which is the line perpendicular to its orbital plane; equivalently, it is the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane. It differs from orbital inclination. At an obliquity of 0 degrees, the two axes point in the same direction; that is, the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane.

> The rotational axis of Earth, for example, is the imaginary line that passes through both the North Pole and South Pole, whereas the Earth's orbital axis is the line perpendicular to the imaginary plane through which the Earth moves as it revolves around the Sun; the Earth's obliquity or axial tilt is the angle between these two lines. Earth's obliquity oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a 41,000-year cycle.

There are some verses in the Quran that mention the concept of axial tilt, which refers to the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbit around the sun. One example is in Surah Al-Anbiya, verse 33, which states:

This verse implies that the sun and the moon each move in a particular orbit, which is consistent with the concept of axial tilt. Another example is in Surah Ya-Sin, verse 40, which states:

This verse also implies that the sun and the moon each move in their own orbit, which is consistent with the concept of axial tilt.

While these verses do not explicitly mention the exact degree of the Earth's axial tilt, they do indicate a basic understanding of the movement of celestial bodies in the sky, which aligns with modern scientific understanding of axial tilt and the movement of celestial bodies in space.
